One of my primary motivations for setting up this blog was to have a centralized place for sharing how 
I am using the combination of the RDKit and the IPython notebook in teaching and research. 
There are many great resources for learning how to use the RDKit python bindings, including
the indispensible ["Getting Started width the RDKit in Python"](http://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html),
Greg Landrum's [RDkit blog](http://rdkit.blogspot.com), 
and a particularly nice example from [the ChEMBL-og](http://chembl.blogspot.com/2014/11/finding-key-compounds-in-med-chemistry.html).
